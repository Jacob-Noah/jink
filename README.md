# jink

> Jink is a strongly-typed, JavaScript-like programming language.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jink-lang/jink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jink-lang/jink) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/365599795886161941.svg)](https://discord.gg/cWzcQz2)

I made Jink to prove to myself that I could, and I plan to support it as long as I see fit. It has been my most difficult project, which makes it the most fun!

## Example

```jink
int example_func(int in) {
    return ++in
}

int out = example_func(1336)
print(out) // Prints 1337 to the console
```

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* cx_Freeze (Only if you want to build an executable. Will be installed through `build-executable.bat`)

## Getting Started

Assuming you have Python 3.6 or newer, you can get started right away!

To launch the REPL:

```cmd
python jink.py
```

To execute your own files:

```cmd
python jink.py C:/path/to/file.jk
```

To execute the example files:

```cmd
python jink.py ./examples/01-hello_world.jk
```

### Building

For Windows users, run `build-executable.bat`. Linux support has not been added yet, and Mac OS X has not been tested.

```cmd
cd build/exe.win32-3.6
jink.exe main.jk
```

## Contributing

I will set up a contribution guide when I can. In the meantime, feel free to provide feedback any way you see fit. This project is still fairly new, after all.

* Enormous thanks to [king1600](https://github.com/king1600) for helping me to better understand interpreter design and providing me the resources and support I needed to carry out this project.

* This project also would not have been possible without the incredible resources on implementing a programming language at [Mihai Bazon's blog](http://lisperator.net).

## P.S.

Don't call me silly for making an interpreted language strongly-typed, call me silly for making it with a loosely-typed language. Haha! xoxo
