> Jink is a strongly-typed, JavaScript-like programming language.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jacob-Noah/jink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jacob-Noah/jink)

I made Jink to prove to myself that I could, and I plan to support it as long as I see fit. It has been my most difficult project, which makes it the most fun!

## Example

```jink

int out = example_func(1336)
print(out) :: Prints 1337 to the console
```

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+

## Getting Started

To build an executable in the current directory, run 

## Contributing

I will set up a contribution guide when I can. In the meantime, feel free to provide feedback any way you see fit. This project is still fairly new, after all.

Don't call me silly for making an interpreted language strongly-typed, call me silly for making it with a loosely-typed language. Haha! xoxo
